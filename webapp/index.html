        Since ancient times, stories of epic battles and mystical legends have been passed through the generations across the rugged and mysterious Highlands of Scotland. From Disney and Pixar, a new tale joins the lore when the courageous Merida confronts tradition and challenges destiny to change her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
        In bringing Merida and Elinor's story to life, directors Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman drew inspiration not only from their own experiences as teenagers, but from their experiences as parentsâ€”in Chapman's case, from her relationship with her daughter, and in Andrews' case, from his relationship with his oldest daughter and three younger sons.
